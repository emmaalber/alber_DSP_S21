    "# Final Project: A Closer Look at the Human Freedom Index\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "For more than a year now, citizens around the world have had to get used to terms like \"lockdown\" and \"mandatory masks\", as well as to the fact that their state suddenly imposes many and at times very strict rules to follow. This consequence of COVID-19 has fueled heated discussions about the concept of freedom in states whose residents otherwise pay little attention to the issue. Yet the freedom of people has been an important matter before this pandemic, and in many countries the freedom to go to the barber shop is the least of citizens' concerns when it comes to their personal liberty.\n",
    "\n",
    "This project aims to shed light at the intricacies of human freedom (HF) around the world in the past decades until 2018 by analyzing data used in a paper about the Human Freedom Index (Vásquez & McMahon, 2020). After some background information about the concepts and the data has been given, the distribution of human freedom in different nations will be visualized and compared. Next, the influence of specific factors such as gender, size of government or business regulations on HF will be assessed. Finally, various models to predict HF will be built, tested and the best-fitting one will be chosen. \n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Background \n",
    "\n",
    "There are countless ways to define freedom. This paper adopts the approach of Vásquez and McMahon, authors of the Human Freedom Index 2020 report, who use \"negative rights\" or \"negative liberty\" as a working definition of human freedom in their paper. The term negative rights was coined by the philosopher Isaiah Berlin, who wrote that negative liberty concerns \"the area within which the subject — a person or group of persons — is or should be left to do or be what he is able to do or be, without interference by other persons (Berlin, 1969, p. 119).\" Accordingly, this paper will compare countries and regions exclusively on the notion of how much (or little) their citizens experience constraint of various forms - especially by their government. \n",
    "While data collection and analysis can be done in a relatively objective manner, it is important to note that the political attitudes of the researchers can play a role, particularly in the selection of variables to be collected and in the interpretation of the results. It should be mentioned here that the editors of the HFI, which is the sole data source for this paper, are two libertarian \"think tanks\" based in the U.S. and Canada, respectively.\n",
    "Vásquez and McMahon (2020) collected and analyzed a broad range of variables operationalizing their definition of freedom from 162 countries. All attained measures were assigned values between 0 and 10, with a higher number representing more freedom (i.e., more safety, human rights, diversity, etc.). The data was aggregated into three indices: An index of personal freedom (PF) and for economic freedom (EF) respectively, whose combination results in the main index of HI. While PF serves as an index for specific personal freedoms such as freedom of religion, expression and identity, EF measures the possibility to engage in voluntary (financial) exchange and competition, and the safety of people and their property.\n",
    "The results of the HFI allow us to evaluate the development of HF over the past decade (since the first index was created in 2008) and allows us to rank and compare countries, as well as to assess the influence of specific variables on HF.\n",
